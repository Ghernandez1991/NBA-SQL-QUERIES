# NBA-SQL-QUERIES

The purpose of this project is some basic exploratory data analysis with SQL on NBA season statistics. 

The data in CSV form can be found here

and here

I use SQL commands to create a data base

Create two tables

2017
and 2018

Then perform various queries on the Database to find out insights not easily visable at first glance.
